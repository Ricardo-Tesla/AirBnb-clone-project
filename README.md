Fields:
- user_id – Unique identifier for each user
- name – Full name of the user
- email – User’s email address (unique)
- password – Encrypted password for authentication
- role – Defines user type (guest or host)

5.2. Properties: Represents the accommodations listed by hosts.

6. Feature Breakdown
The AirBnB Clone project includes several core features that replicate the functionality of the original AirBnB platform. Each feature is designed to provide a smooth, secure, and user-friendly experience for both guests and hosts.

6.1. User Management
Allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures secure authentication and role-based access, enabling users to act as guests or hosts within the platform.

6.2. Property Management
Hosts can list, update, and remove their properties with details such as location, price, description, and images. This feature provides a structured way for hosts to showcase their listings and attract potential guests.

6.3. Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates. It manages booking availability, prevents overlaps, and ensures accurate tracking of reservations.

6.4. Search and Filtering
Users can search for properties based on location, price, rating, and amenities. This feature enhances discoverability and helps users find accommodations that best suit their preferences.

6.5. Review and Rating System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings after their stay. This feature builds trust within the community by allowing users to share feedback and improve service quality.

6.6. Payment Integration
Provides a secure checkout process for guests to complete bookings. It supports multiple payment methods and ensures transaction accuracy and safety.

6.7. Responsive UI/UX Design
Ensures the application works seamlessly across all devices and screen sizes. This feature focuses on usability, accessibility, and maintaining a consistent visual experience for all users.

7. API Security
Security is a critical component of the AirBnB Clone project, ensuring that user data, bookings, and payments remain protected. The backend APIs will implement several key security measures to maintain system integrity and user trust.

7.1. Authentication
All users will be required to log in before accessing protected resources. Authentication will be managed using secure methods such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication. This ensures that only verified users can interact with the application’s core features.

7.2. Authorization
Role-based access control will be implemented to restrict certain actions to specific users. For example, only hosts can create or manage property listings, while guests can only make bookings. This prevents unauthorized access and misuse of data.

7.3. Data Encryption
Sensitive data, such as passwords and payment details, will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest. This measure protects against data theft or interception during network communication.

7.4. Rate Limiting
APIs will use rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect the system from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This ensures that the backend remains stable and accessible even under high traffic conditions.

7.5. Input Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent common security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection. This helps maintain data integrity and prevents exploitation of the API endpoints.

7.6. Secure Payment Handling
Payment operations will be processed through trusted third-party payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). This ensures compliance with financial security standards and protects users from fraud.

7.7. Why API Security Is Crucial

Protecting User Data: Prevents exposure of personal information such as emails, passwords, and payment details.
Securing Transactions: Ensures safe and verified payments between guests and hosts.
Maintaining Trust: Builds credibility by safeguarding user interactions and preventing data breaches.
Preventing System Abuse: Shields the platform from malicious activities and unauthorized API usage.

8. CI/CD Pipeline
Overview
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code. They ensure that changes are integrated frequently, verified through automated tests, and deployed reliably to production without manual intervention. For the AirBnB Clone project, CI/CD improves development efficiency, reduces errors, and ensures that new features are delivered quickly and safely.

Importance for the Project
Faster Development: Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployment.
Improved Code Quality: Ensures code passes tests before merging into the main branch.
Reliable Deployment: Reduces human errors during production deployment.
Team Collaboration: Supports multiple developers working concurrently with minimal conflicts.

Tools
GitHub Actions: Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying code.
Docker: Packages the application into containers for consistent deployment across environments.
Other Options: Tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI can also be used depending on team preferences.
